During my Android app development internship at CodSoft, I crafted Window Notifications using Java. Here's a peek at my project's key points:

📝 Designed notification windows with titles, messages, and optional images/icons.
📲 Brought these notifications to life, seamlessly displaying them.
👆 Enabled user-friendly interactions like swipe-to-delete.
🌈 Customized notification visuals, from fonts to colors.
🔍 Managed errors and exceptions during display.
🧪 Thoroughly tested compatibility across diverse operating systems.
